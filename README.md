# SQL and Databases Flashcards

The flashcards are based on the Udemy course: [Complete SQL and Databases Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-sql-databases-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=OF83024E) (external link). Highly recommended course, it covers a lot of things from beginner to intermediate.

The course is focused on PostgreSQL but the knowledge is generally usable in other databases as well.

Simply import the text file flashcards into Anki.
